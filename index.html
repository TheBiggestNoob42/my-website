        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> I'm a pretty average dude. I haven't done much. I watch a lot of anime, play a lot of games, and do a lot of comp sci. I
            also hold a lot of strong beliefs</p>
        <p>    I was born in January 6th, 2003 in Dubai. I moved to the U.S. when I was three years old. When I was in elementary school,
            I read a lot of books and played a lot. However, in middle school, I got into competitions. I became interested in math
            and school.</p>
